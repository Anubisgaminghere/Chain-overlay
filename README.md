Have an API key ready to copy and paste, i use the same on i do for Torn PDA. it is stored locally, no need to worry.
copy the script, paste in tampermonkey, run. 
you cannot miss it. you will be prompted for API key to get countdown timer

The script polls every 30s, it will take a moment to catch up to new hits. it should start blinking at 1:30 left on the countdown
